## Investigating the Impact of Marketing Spend on Enrollments and Sales
### Project Overview:
This project explores the relationship between Marketing Spend, Enrollments, and Sales to determine if increased investment in marketing activities leads to higher enrollments and sales. Using real-world data, we aim to validate or refute the hypothesis that a higher marketing spend positively impacts both the number of enrollments and sales performance.

### Objectives:
- To examine the correlation between Marketing Spend and Enrollments.
- To investigate the correlation between Marketing Spend and Sales.
- To build statistical models that quantify the influence of marketing spend on enrollments and sales.
### Key Methods:
- Pearson correlation analysis was conducted to assess the strength and significance of the relationships.
- Linear regression models were built using statsmodels to predict enrollments based on marketing spend, providing a detailed view of the magnitude and significance of marketing efforts on the outcomes.
- Visualizations such as scatter plots and regression lines were used to illustrate the relationships.
### Findings:
- Statistical tests revealed the presence (or lack) of significant correlations between marketing spend and the key metrics, offering actionable insights into how marketing investments influence business outcomes.
